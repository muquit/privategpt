# Contributing

Please send a pull request if you add features, fix bugs or update the documentation. 

If you want to update the documentation, **please do not update README.md directly**, 
rather update the Markdown files in _markdowns/_ directory. README.md 
is generated by [markdown_helper](https://github.com/BurdetteLamar/markdown_helper) ruby gem by
assembling the individual Markdown files in the _markdowns/_ directory. If you
would like to generate README.md, run `scripts/combine_markdowns.sh` (you will need the required tools of
course)
